            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
                technologies.
                With several years of experience in the field, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of
                projects,
                from creating responsive and user-friendly front-end interfaces to developing robust and scalable
                server-side applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                My skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end libraries and frameworks
                such as React.
                On the back-end, I am experienced in working with technologies like Node.js and databases like MongoDB
                and SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions that not only meet but exceed client expectations.
                I am also committed to staying updated with the latest web development trends and technologies to ensure
                that I provide
                innovative and efficient solutions for every project.
            </p>
